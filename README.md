INFORMATION

The foundation for this project was made by coe posted on Geeks For Geeks by Shaurya Uppal, demonstrating
a working example of a CRC generator, and then modified to show the needed steps for our project.

The posted code generates the CRC from an input data word and divisor. This project modifies the code to
print the intermediate steps in the CRC calculation to show the generation process. It also adds a UI to 
allow the user to specify the data word and checksum, and control the stepping process themself.

The UI is dependent on the Python library Tkinter. Tkinter (TK INTERface) is a Python library that helps
create easy user interfaces. It comes standard on most Python installations, but if you do not have a copy,
it can be installed [here](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html).

This project requires a version of Python3.

Usage:
python3 crc.py
